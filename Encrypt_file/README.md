                                                       Encrypt_file
                                                       
                                The cryptography library can be installed using the below command:

                                         pip install cryptography
                                         
                                In the cryptography library, there is a cryptography algorithm called fernet. 
                              
                               We will use the fernet module to encrypt the file
                    
                                 Run the Encrypt.py in pycharm 
                        
                                   output will be generated then the file is Encrypted

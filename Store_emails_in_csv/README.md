                                               Store emails in CSV
                                               
                                This project contains a simple script to extract email messages from an IMAP server.

                                This depends on the BeautifulSoup library and lxml for extracting text from HTML messages.
                                
                                 We should have a file credentials.txtin the project folder
                                 
                                 Run the code in pycharm Store_emails_in_CSV
                                 
                                 This generates mails.csv in the current directory.
                                 
                                 The generated CSV file contains the following fields for each message:

                                          Date
                                          From (Sender)
                                          Subject
                                          Message text

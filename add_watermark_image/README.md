                                                In this project take an image and save to project folder
                                                
                                                   Then add watermark to that image
                                                   
                                                   This project uses PIL module to add the watermark
                                                   
                                                   Run the project watermark_image.py
                                                   
                                                   watermark_image.py [image_path]
                                                   
                                                   Enter the  the [image_path] with the image you want to add watermark to
                                                   
                                                   Output will be generated image with a desired watermark.

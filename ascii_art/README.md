                                                    This Project will take an image and print out an ASCII-art.
                                                    
                                                    This project uses opencv to process image
                                                    
                                                     numpy to manipulate arrays. 
                                                     
                                                     Save  one image to project folder 
                                                     
                                                     Run the code ascii_art.py
                                                     
                                                     Output will generate the ascii-art for a given image
